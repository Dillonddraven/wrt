            <h2>Blockchain</h2>
            <h3>The History of Blochchain</h3>
            <h4>PreBlockchain(1970s-1980s):</h4>
            <p>The fundamental elements of blockchain were developed via cryptography and the use of public and private keys </p>
            <h4>1991</h4>
            <p>Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta introduced a practice that would time stamp events and prevent them from being back-dated or changed. </p>
            <h4>2008-2009</h4>
            <p>Bitcoin is created by someone under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, thus creating the world's first cryptocurrency. </p>
            <h4>2013-2015</h4>
            <p>Ethereum was proposed and created by Vitalik Buterin to introduce its own programming language that would allow developers to create unique applications for the network.</p>
            <h3>How Does Blockchain Work? </h3>
            <p>At its core, the blockchain is simply a system of distributed databases, or ledgers, that are shared among the nodes of a computer network. Blockchain networks are critical for maintaining the security, fidelity, and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as they do not require trust from any third party. Once a transaction is logged on the blockchain it is viable to all of its users and cannot be removed or altered. Additionally, the blockchain spread over many computer networks which makes it extremely resistant to malicious attacks. </p>
            <h3>How Blockchain is more than using Bitcoin to buy a coffee</h3>
            <p>While many people think the future of Bitcoin involves them pulling out their phone and sending a little bit of Bitcoin in exchange for their daily coffee its potential is far greater. For example, blockchain tech is ideal for supply chain management since it provides its users with an alterable database that makes tracking and monitoring products simple and efficient. The blockchain network is also ideal for ensuring voter privacy and security since the user's choice cannot be altered. </p>

        <section id="hash">
            <h2>What is Hashing</h2>
            <p>Hashing is a security measure that takes input data and performs a series of operations on the data to convert it into a new form that usually appears random with a fixed length. For example, Sha 256 converts any input data into a text string with a set length of 256 characters. This can be done with any type of input data, from text files to entire databases. 
            </p>
            <h2>How are Values Computed</h2>
            <p>
                This is usually done through a series of mathematical operations and algorithms that make it impossible to determine the original value from the has value.  
            </p>
            <h2>Why are Hashes Used</h2>
            <p>The main benefit of hash comes from its ability to ensure the primary purposes of Cybersecurity, those being Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Hash values are deterministic meaning that the same the same input always returns the same output. Hash values require very little time to be computed so they are ideal for situations in which users to protect large amounts of information. Especially if the information is similar as even a minute change to the input will lead to a dramatically different output

        <section id="proof">
            <h2>Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake What's the difference 
            </h2>
            <h2>PoW</h2>
            <p>Proof of Work (PoW) is a system that was made popular by Bitcoin in which the user (miners) are required to use computational power to solve complex mathematical formulas to log hash values onto the blockchain.
            </p>
            <h2>
                The PoW Process 
            </h2>
            <p>First transactions are gathered onto a block by miners, and then those same miners must solve for the hash values of these transactions in order to receive a reward (usually Bitcoins). These hashes are crucial to the integrity of the Blockchain network as they ensure that transactions remain secure and that no changes can be made to the network without notifying the rest of the users. Upon completion, the successful block is added to the blockchain, and the miner is rewarded with their share of Bitcoin.</p>
            <h2>
                PoW Takeaways
            </h2>
            <p> While Pow promotes decentralization and security it is also extremely energy intensive since it requires many computers to devote large amounts of their resources to solving the hash values of each transaction.</p>
            <h2>PoS</h2>
            <p>Proof of Stake(PoS) operations on a consensus system in which it selects validator to lock up or “stake” their coins on the network to log transactions, rather than solving hash puzzles.</p>
            <h2>PoS Proces</h2>
            <p>
                First, the users are selected to stake their assets on the network. The amount user chooses to stake on the network directly influences how likely they are to be chosen to validate transactions. Once chosen the validator checks if the transactions are valid, creates the new block, and then adds it to the network. As a reward, the validator receives transaction fees, as opposed to a block reward like in PoW.
            </p>
